<h2>Curl</h2>
Ideally you should be accessing the API via a programming language with a suitable curl library (such as SDM's provided sdm_curl).
But sometimes it is useful to see what is happening for debugging.

<P>
See <a href="https://docs.jgi.doe.gov/x/uw28Ag" target="_blank">Query APIs</a> for some examples of using curl to query JAMO directly.
